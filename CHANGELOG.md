# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial implementation of graph port traits
- MockGraphStore implementation for testing
- Comprehensive error handling with TYL framework integration
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS for shortest path)
- Graph analytics interfaces (centrality, community detection, pattern recognition)
- Query execution interfaces for custom graph operations
- Health monitoring capabilities
- Complete test coverage including integration tests
- Documentation and examples

### Features
- **GraphStore**: CRUD operations for nodes and relationships
- **GraphTraversal**: Path finding, neighbor discovery, graph exploration
- **GraphAnalytics**: Centrality calculations, community detection, recommendations
- **GraphQueryExecutor**: Custom query support with read/write validation
- **GraphHealth**: Connection health and statistics monitoring
- **Mock Implementation**: Full in-memory implementation for testing
- **Async Support**: Complete async/await support throughout

### Technical Details
- Follows hexagonal architecture principles
- Integrates with TYL error framework (`tyl-errors`)
- Uses TYL database core functionality (`tyl-db-core`)
- Builder patterns for easy object construction
- Comprehensive type system with serialization support
- Performance optimizations for traversal algorithms

## [0.1.0] - TBD

### Added
- Initial release of tyl-graph-port
- Core graph database interfaces
- Mock implementation
- Documentation and examples
- Integration with TYL framework ecosystem

## Version Bumping Strategy

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **MAJOR** version (x.0.0): Breaking API changes, incompatible trait modifications
- **MINOR** version (0.x.0): New functionality, additional traits/methods, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** version (0.0.x): Bug fixes, documentation improvements, performance optimizations

### Release Process

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Create git tag: `git tag v{version}`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v{version}`
5. GitHub Actions automatically publishes to crates.io

### Breaking Changes Policy

- Trait method signature changes require MAJOR version bump
- Adding optional parameters with defaults is MINOR
- New traits/methods are MINOR additions
- Performance improvements are PATCH releases

## Notes

- This module follows TYL framework standards
- All public APIs use `TylResult<T>` for error handling
- Mock implementation suitable for production testing
- Designed for database-agnostic graph operations
- Full async/await support for scalable applications
